# Memory-Game
A simple, interactive card-matching game built with HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Test your memory skills by flipping cards to find matching pairs. Be careful, thoughâ€”you only have 8 tries before the game ends!

# About the Project
This project was a task from Prokoders to showcase my skills by delivering an interactive and dynamic web application, using only HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and plain JavaScript (not React).

# Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click on the cards to flip them and try to find matching pairs.
- **Score Tracking**: Each successful match increases your score by 10 points.
- **Limited Attempts**: You have a maximum of 8 wrong tries. Exceeding this limit results in a game over.
- **Game Over Message**: Displays a "Game Over" message if you reach the maximum number of wrong tries, with an option to retry.
- **Win Congratulations**: Receive a congratulatory message upon successfully matching all pairs, along with an option to play again.
- **Dynamic Image Ordering**: The order of the images changes with each new game, ensuring a different experience every time.

# Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the game.
- **CSS & Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play
- Click on cards to flip them over.
- Try to match pairs of cards. If the cards match, they remain face-up.
- If the cards do not match, they will flip back over after a short delay.
- Keep track of your score and wrong tries.
- The game ends when you either match all pairs or exceed 8 wrong tries.
